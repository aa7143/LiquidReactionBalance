# fluid mechnacis (LiquidReactionBalance)
The project evaluates the inputs, calculates the mass balance, energy balance and the volume balance and outputs graphs of each input vs output balances. Balances equations are a common problem in fluid mechanics. The project creates a collection that takes the states of the inlet including the volume, concentration and temperature and evaluates them using given constants to plot a graph of between the inlet and outlet masses, energies and concentrations. The test file instantiates the reactionBalance class and runs instances of reactions with correct values and wrong values. If wrong values are given, an error message is displayed and a default value is used. The output are shown in Reaction1.PNG and Reaction2.PNG
