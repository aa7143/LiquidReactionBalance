# fluid mechnacis (LiquidReactionBalance)
The project evaluates the inputs, calculates the mass balance, energy balance and the state balance and outputs graphs of each input vs output balances. Balances equations are a common problem in fluid mechanics. The equations used include the mass balance equation:

The project creates a collection that takes inlet values including the volume, concentration and temperature and evaluates them using given constants to plot a graph of between the inlet and outlet masses, energies and concentrations. The test file instantiates the reactionBalance class and runs instances of reactions with correct values and wrong values. If wrong values are given, an error message is displayed and a default value is used. The output are shown in

It also outputs a data.txt file in the output directory
